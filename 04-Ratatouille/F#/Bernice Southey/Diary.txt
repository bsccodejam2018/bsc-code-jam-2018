I've definitely reached a level where I have to stop hacking my way through and learn some more constructs in the language. I find I keep using what works instead of what works best just because it's easier.  My data types are a mess and I'm not leveraging the power of F#. I can now read Attie's solutions and learn new tricks and better coding from them. Also this problem was really hard.
