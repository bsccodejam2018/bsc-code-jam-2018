# Graph Theory

| Concept | Explanation |

| **Graph Theory** | Roelof to complete  |
| **Complete Graphs** | A complete graph is a graph where every vertex has an edge to every other vertex. In the Freeform Factory problem we had to complete the subgraphs to solve it. |
| **Bipartite Graphs** | A bipartite graph is a graph where the vertices are divided into two groups and there are no edges between any vertices in the same group. We used a bipartite graph in the Freeform Factory problem where one group was the machines and one group was the workers. An edge can only be between a machine and a worker.|
