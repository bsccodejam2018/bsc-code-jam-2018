It's so so so much easier in C#. Mostly just because I wasn't trying to learn the language. I could still use recursion where it made sense but I could also use state and even good old fashioned loops. It was much more boring to code than F#. It's hard to compare honestly because I had already thought through the solution implementation and could reuse a lot of that and the equivalent knowledge is very unbalanced.
