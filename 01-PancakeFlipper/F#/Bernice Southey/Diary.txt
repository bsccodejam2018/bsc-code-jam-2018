Trying to code before even going through a tutorial is insane, but weirdly fun. Turns out I need a deadline to learn a new language. Always say I love deadlines... Recursion and pattern matching rock. I learned that I should start at the end and code backwards so the compiler knows what I'm doing. Materialising an index of out of nowhere is amazing. I don't really understand my own code. I do love that once it compiles, which is hard, really hard, it just works. I ended up using google to find little bits of F# which I attempted to stitch together. I would not have been able to solve this without some rescuing from Attie.
