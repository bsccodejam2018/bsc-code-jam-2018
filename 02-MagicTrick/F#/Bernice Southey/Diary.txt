Sequences are a handy alternative to recursion. They're sort of like linq select. File and string manipulation is much harder than implementing the algorithm. I can't figure out how to pipe out a single element from an enumerable and have to keep adding new lines which feels very messy. I discovered sets, and am still confused about lists and arrays. Getting code to compile is a relief, and requires hacking. Elegance is still a long way off. My syntax and data structure knowledge is mostly big gaping holes.
